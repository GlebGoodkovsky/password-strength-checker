## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Information

### Privacy Assurance

- **Zero Network Communication** - All password analysis happens locally in your browser
- **No Tracking** - No analytics, cookies, or telemetry
- **No Server Processing** - Your passwords never touch any server
- **Self-Contained** - All dependencies are bundled locally

### Limitations

While this tool provides password strength estimates:
- **Not a Security Guarantee** - Password strength is an estimate, not a guarantee
- **Offline Analysis Only** - Doesn't check against known breach databases
- **Dictionary Limits** - Uses built-in dictionaries, not comprehensive lists

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Strength Analysis** - Instant feedback as you type
- **Strength Meter** - Visual 0-4 score with color-coded indicators
- **Crack Time Estimate** - Shows how long it would take to brute-force your password
- **Actionable Suggestions** - Specific tips to improve weak passwords
- **Dark/Light Mode** - Automatic theme switching based on system preference
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessible UI** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Tech Stack)

The password analysis happens entirely in your browser using fundamental web technologies:

- **HTML5** - Page structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Styling with CSS variables for theming
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** - Core application logic
- **[zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)** - Dropbox's password strength estimation library (MIT licensed)
- **GitHub Pages** - Static hosting with automatic SSL

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Visit the [Live Demo](https://glebgoodkovsky.github.io/password-strength-checker/)**
2. **Type or paste a password** in the input field
3. **View real-time analysis**:
   - Strength level (0-4)
   - Estimated crack time
   - Specific improvement suggestions
4. **Toggle theme** using the üåó/‚òÄÔ∏è button
5. **Experiment freely** - nothing is saved or transmitted

> **Note**: For maximum security, consider disconnecting from the internet before testing real passwords

## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was developed as a practical exploration of client-side security applications. It demonstrates core concepts of privacy-focused web development, including zero-backend architecture, client-side processing, and security considerations. The implementation involved using AI assistance as a learning tool to understand and implement the zxcvbn library while ensuring all code remains original and purpose-built for this specific application. The goal was to create a tool that respects user privacy while providing valuable security feedback.
